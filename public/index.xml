      <description>2023/24 - Our Season So Far After finishing second in our first ever season in Division 6 of the Barnet Sunday Football League, we were handed a sizeable promotion up to Division 1.

      <description>Player of the Month: November 2023 And your November 2023 Miyagi Bonsai Player of the Month is&amp;hellip;
Cal Cook! Following in the footsteps of our first ever Player of the Month Steph Savva, our American attacking midfielder Cal Cook took the award for November.
Cal had an excellent month in November, playing only 2 of our 3 fixtures but scoring 3 goals and assisting once in the process. His brace against PS Birlikspor helped us to a 4-0 win, in a game where he was causing problems for the defence throughout.</description>

      <description>Our Journey On a hot summer’s day in 2020, five friends went for a kickabout in the local park.As they sat down to drink some water, one of the lads jokingly asked the rest, ‘Why don’t we create our own team?’ and from that point on, the work began from transforming this dream into reality. The groundwork started from 2020, including processes to set up the club branding including naming and kits; and conversations were had daily regarding our visions for the club both in the short-term and long-term.</description>

<h1 style="font-size: 45px; font-weight: bold">Match Report - Highgate Albion 2s (H) </h1>
<br/>
<p>As winter starts to approach, a gloomy Mount Grace was the setting for a crucial encounter against a familiar opponent on Sunday. With just one position and no love lost between these two teams last season, we knew that this fixture - now being played in the league above - would be a close one, and one that would require a level of combativeness if we were to come away with anything. Roza had 1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss to show for 3 respectable performances thus far; so they were hoping to build on last week&rsquo;s victory with a win.</p>
<hr>
<h4 align="left" class="tbh4" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">
Starting XI: Michael Andreou; Deano Spyrou, Giorgio Koullas, Chris Johnson, Jake Koumi; Terry Savva, Moh Kataria, Ben Reynolds; Steph Savva, Danny Smith, Alex Andreou
</h4>
<hr>
<p>In the final fixture of last campaign (a 2-2 draw with the same opponent), the game ended by boiling over - but this fixture felt different at the beginning, with both teams looking rather cagey. Highgate had more of the ball early on, although neither team was giving the other team&rsquo;s goalkeeper an awful lot to think about in the early stages.</p>
<p>We found ourselves 0-1 down with around 26 minutes on the clock, when a midfield battle was lost before Highgate clipped a high ball in behind. Their centre-forward beat our defenders and goalkeeper to the ball, sliding to half-volley it home. It was a great finish, but more importantly it was a wake-up call for Roza to find the intensity that we had been playing with up to this point this season.</p>
<p>It certainly did feel like a turning point, as we began to find our way into opposition territory. Alex Andreou in particular managed to get in behind a couple of times - one of which hitting the post from an acute angle - whilst Steph Savva was beginning to take on his man and get some dangerous crosses in from the right. Meanwhile, Moh Kataria was his usual aggressive self, battling strongly in the middle of the park.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we went into half-time behind for the first time this season; there was plenty of work to do and improvement to find in the second half if we were to get anything.</p>
<p>Roza were a different team after the break though, flying out of the blocks. An early Andreou chance was saved, before moments later he cut inside and sat the goalkeeper down with a delicious chip. The body language of both teams had changed, and Roza were clearly in the ascendancy, pushing to go ahead.</p>
<p>Efforts from Savva, Andreou and Smith were evidence of Roza pushing for a much-needed 2-1 lead; but unfortunately it was the away side who went ahead. A goal-kick which didn&rsquo;t reach its target was overturned by Highgate who went on to take the lead against the run of play.</p>
<p>We continued to play our game though, with Jake Koumi&rsquo;s dangerous cross nearly ending in a goal and a number of other chances for an equaliser being squirmed. Substitutions were made just after the hour mark, with full backs Deano Spyrou and Jake Koumi being replaced by debutant Harry Small and a familiar face in Ollie Begueria, before 5 minutes later Michael Georgiades replaced Terry Savva in the midfield.</p>
<p>Soon after the changes were made, Roza were left with a mountain to climb; Highgate went 1-3 up through a piece of magic from their right winger. He jinked down the line, cut inside and absolutely smashed one into the top corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance.</p>
<p>We now had 15 minutes to find 2 goals if we were to at least rescue the draw but - with chances coming aplenty, both from open play and set pieces - the players and supporters knew that Roza were not out of it. Danny Smith had a shot cleared off the line before then striking the crossbar and not quite getting the connection that he wanted from a corner. Additionally, Andreou continued to look dangerous, whilst Kataria had a great chance on the edge of the box but his effort was saved, and Chris Johnson also saw his header go wide. Time was ticking and, if we were to come back into it, one of these chances was going to have to be converted. Michael Georgiades made a big impact in the middle, helping us in the build-up, before his brother Demetris Georgiades was brought on for a fatigued Ben Reynolds.</p>
<p>It was beginning to look unlikely for us, when  Danny Smith - Roza&rsquo;s top scorer thus far this season - looped a volley which floated over the keeper into the back of the net. There was 6 minutes of normal time remaining and due to be a considerable amount of time added, mainly because Highgate&rsquo;s goalkeeper was doing all he could to waste time, so there was hope.</p>
<p>The home side created more and more, but the ball just would not go in. We had now played the majority of added time, and chances just continued to go astray.</p>
<p>With moments to go, in what was to be the last passage of play in the match, we had a throw-in on the left-hand side. Harry Small was the man called to take it on his debut, and he was in charge of Roza&rsquo;s last throw of the dice. His lengthy throw dropped dangerously in the six yard box, and Demetris Georgiades was the man in the melée who managed to get a touch. The ball bounced up into the top corner, with the Highgate defender doing all he could to head it away but all he could do was help it into the roof of the net.</p>
<p>Chaos commenced, as Roza&rsquo;s hard-work paid off to grind out a result right at the death. The final whistle went moments after the ball crossed the line, and Highgate&rsquo;s players desperately appealed to the referee, whilst everyone on Roza&rsquo;s side ran around and grasped each other delightedly.</p>
<p>This performance, as with Trent Park, was a prime example of how far our mentality has come since last season - never giving up. We are disappointed to not be celebrating a win, particularly because of all the chances missed, but if we continue to perform in this manner, the first home win of the season is coming soon.</p>
<h3 style= "font-size: 25px">
We keep battling until the death. Up The Roza. <img src="/Images/rozabadge-removebg-preview.png" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 50px;" alt="AFC Roza" />

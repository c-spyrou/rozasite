      <description>2023/24 - Our Season So Far After finishing second in our first ever season in Division 6 of the Barnet Sunday Football League, we were handed a sizeable promotion up to Division 1. This entailed a climb from the 8th tier to the 3rd tier of the BSFL pyramid, meaning that we had a big challenge on our hands. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;ve got on so far&amp;hellip;

      <description>Player of the Month: November 2023 And your November 2023 Miyagi Bonsai Player of the Month is&amp;hellip;
Cal Cook! Following in the footsteps of our first ever Player of the Month Steph Savva, our American attacking midfielder Cal Cook took the award for November.
Cal had an excellent month in November, playing only 2 of our 3 fixtures but scoring 3 goals and assisting once in the process. His brace against PS Birlikspor helped us to a 4-0 win, in a game where he was causing problems for the defence throughout.</description>

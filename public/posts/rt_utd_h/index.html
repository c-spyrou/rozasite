        <p>In the early stages of the game, chances were few and far between with both teams struggling to hold onto the ball. Enfield probably shaded it in terms of possession and territory, with Roza finding it hard to get a meaningful shot away.
It was the our hosts who took the lead midway into the first half through a good finish which left Rajan Ranu with no chance.
Roza began to react after going a goal down, starting to get a few shots on target, albeit ones which were not overly troublesome for the Enfield goalkeeper. A deflected effort from Steph Savva required good reflexes from the ‘keeper, and he reacted well to save low.
Harry Small gingerly left the field to be replaced by Rees Colgan half an hour into the game, moments before we were awarded a penalty for a high foot on Moh Kataria. Kataria was tenacious in his closing down of the ball and his hard work paid dividends when Iddo Razin, back on penalties, calmly placed it in the top right corner.
Roza had a 1-1 draw going into the break and the match was very much in the balance.
The second half began strongly for the away side, with Alex Andreou hitting a couple of shots at goal, Steph Savva becoming increasingly involved and the half-time substitute Saj Rajaratnam helping to drive us forward. Rajaratnam was not the only person to come on at the break, with Cal Cook joining the fray for goalscorer Iddo Razin.
Despite some pressure, Enfield still looked fairly likely at the other end, and they scored before the hour to put themselves 2-1 up. As Roza pushed for the equalizer late in the game, the deficit increased to 3-1 where Begueria was unlucky to see his deflection spin into the bottom corner.
A closely contested contest now looked out of reach for us, and it would have got in further away if not for an exceptional penalty save from Rajan Ranu.
Sunday morning’s game was one to forget for the boys, as we return to Mount Grace to face RT United in the Premier Cup this week.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 45px; font-weight: bold">Match Report - RT United (h) </h1>
<p>In a fixture where two teams had never met before, AFC Roza hosted bottom of the league RT United at Mount Grace School. Looking to improve their current form, and put last week’s poor result behind them, there was a mutual “must win” vibe around the camp.</p>
<hr>
<h4 align="left" class="tbh4" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">
<p>Starting XI: Rajan Ranu; Harry Small, Chris Johnson, Jake Koumi, Ollie Begueria; Danny Smith, Ben Reynolds, Moh Kataria; Iddo Razin, Steph Savva, Alex Andreou</p>
</h4>
<hr>
<p>Around the 15-minute mark, Alex Andreou spun around the RT Right Back, drawing a foul outside the area. His freekick was saved, but could only be parried out to Chris Johnson, who headed home for his first of the season to put the Rose 1-0 up.</p>
<p>5 minutes before the break, Steph Savva found himself bombing down the right wing. After jinking past a hopeless defender, Savva fizzed in a cross that found its way to Andreou’s feet. A poor first touch meant that he had to toe poke his effort, which trickled into the bottom left corner after deflecting off the centre back. Not the prettiest goal Andreou will score, but an important one nonetheless, with Roza going into half-time 2 goals to the good.</p>
<p>A poor start to the second half saw RT United pull a goal back after a mix up at the back following a corner. Jake Koumi, with a moment to forget, scuffed a clearance into his own net. This did not stop our skipper from losing confidence though, who kept organising and making crucial challenges throughout the match.</p>
<p>A bold decision was made by the gaffer to change the midfield 3 and both fullbacks. While the new 11 were still gelling together, RT United saw their opportunity to capitalise. A volley that looped over Rajan Ranu saw the visitors equalise with 60 minutes on the clock. 5 minutes later, the RT Centre Back found himself high up the pitch in Roza’s box, who rifled a cracking effort across goal into the bottom left-hand corner. Everyone associated with AFC Roza felt like a knockout blow had been landed, however, if this season has taught us anything, it&rsquo;s that Roza should never be written off until the last kick of the game…</p>
<p>From then on out there was only one team who looked like scoring. After multiple waves of attack, drama unfolded when a defender managed to clear a shot destined for top bins off the line…with his arm. Penalty to Roza. Adam Shaw was the brave man to step up, who usually has a good record from the spot. His effort to the keepers right was saved, only to be smashed in from close range on the rebound by Andreou. 3-3.</p>
<p>With 10 minutes of the 90 left, Roza kept banging on the door, looking for that elusive winner. Shaw, with some tricky feet, danced his way past two defenders in the box. The RT keeper tried to smother the ball, only for it to go loose and fall at the feet of a hattrick- hungry Andreou. Alex, with the easiest goal he will ever score, tapped in from a yard out. In hindsight, his knee slide celebration looked rather foolish as the referee, for reasons still unknown, had disallowed the goal. An outraged Mike Anastasiou stormed the pitch, confronting the referee. After many pleasantries were exchanged, Anastasiou saw red and had to manage from afar. The game remained level.</p>
<p>5 minutes on the clock. Roza continued to apply pressure to the RT United back line. Michael Andreou found himself through on goal and managed to chip the keeper, however his effort was not goal bound. His older brother Alex tapped in again, thinking he had scored the winner for the second time. It wasn’t meant to be though, as Michael was originally deemed to be in an offside position.</p>
<p>In the dying embers of the game, Roza had one more chance, one more opportunity to grab all 3 points and save themselves from the embarrassment of throwing away a 2-goal lead. After a Roza effort had struck the hand of an RT United defender, a free kick was awarded 25 yards outside the box. Who better than Hayden Munro to step up? Munro lined up to take the free kick and caught</p>
<p>the goalkeeper off guard, firing a low yet powerful strike past him at the near post to give his team the crucial winner. In what was the last kick of the game, Munro had won it for Roza. The bench erupted in a mixture of ecstasy and relief and burst on to the pitch, smothering the day’s hero. After being left out of last week’s squad, Hayden Munro had a point to prove, and what better way to do that than scoring a last minute free-kick to bring all 3 points home.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 45px; font-weight: bold">Match Report - Trent Park (H) </h1>
<br/>
<p>As the 24/25 BSFL Season made it&rsquo;s long-awaited introduction, the setting was our new home pitch: Mount Grace School. The boys had been training hard ahead of the campaign, so this fixture couldn&rsquo;t come sooner. A mild morning entailed the visit of familiar opponents in Trent Park, so we knew what was ahead of us as we aimed to earn our first three points.</p>
<hr>
<h4 align="left" class="tbh4" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">
Starting XI: Rajan Ranu; Giorgio Koullas, Chris Johnson, Jake Koumi, Ollie Begueria; Terry Savva, Hayden Munro, Moh Kataria; Michael Andreou, Steph Savva, Alex Andreou
</h4>
<hr>
<p>After a friendly with the same opponents ended up a seven-goal thriller, many were anticipating this to be an attack-minded, high-scoring affair before kick-off. Although they weren&rsquo;t to be disappointed, it didn&rsquo;t start as the most open of games; with cobwebs clearly being blown off for both sides on what is a small and intimate Mount Grace pitch. Moh Kataria on his debut, and Hayden Munro on his return, were both typically combative in the middle of the park alongside the returning Terry Savva.</p>
<p>As the half-hour mark approached and neither team was dominating, it was Roza who took the lead; to the delight of the numerous spectators who had come hoping for a home victory. Michael Andreou was the first goalscorer of the season for us, latching onto a loose ball in the box to finish into an empty net. Andreou, who has impressed in pre-season, ensured that the manager&rsquo;s choice of playing him was not the wrong one - not just with the goal, but also looking dangerous throughout the first half.</p>
<p>The lead only lasted around 10 minutes though. Trent Park&rsquo;s long throw bounced around the edge of the box before being volleyed home by an opposing attacker. This was far from an easy finish, and although Roza won&rsquo;t be happy with their defensive setup, credit has to be given to the goalscorer.</p>
<p>As half-time approached, it was Roza&rsquo;s familiar #9 Steph Savva who ensured that we had the lead going into the break. A flick on from Michael Andreou found Savva in the channel, and he smashed it home from a relatively tight angle, giving the &lsquo;keeper no chance. Our #9 has a good record in opening games of the season and has also enjoyed himself against Trent Park in the past - so it was no surprise that he was the man to put us ahead.</p>
<p>Half-time came and, despite our lead, we knew that the performance could be improved. The game was lacking chances at both ends and, in reality, both teams had been clinical; but Roza knew that they could improve the control that they had in the game. The introductions of Danny Smith and Ben Reynolds at the break were hopefully going to help us to achieve this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second half didn&rsquo;t begin exactly as The Rose had envisaged. A formidable goal from the Trent Park left-winger saw him cut inside and whip a shot right into the top-corner, leaving Ranu with no chance. Although Koullas had been doing a good job of looking after their danger man, all he needed was half a yard to put the away side back level.</p>
<p>Despite numerous setbacks, Roza still wouldn&rsquo;t die. Some more substitutes had been made with Costantinos Spyrou replacing Ollie Begueria, Iddo Razin replacing Michael Andreou and Adam Shaw replacing Alex Andreou; but it was Steph Savva who added another, putting us ahead for the third time. This time, Danny Smith&rsquo;s introduction paid dividends, with his deft pass being finished clinically once again by Savva. With about 25 minutes still to go though, there was still life in this one&hellip;</p>
<p>Trent Park began to push for an equaliser, sensing the urgency required as the latter minutes ticked down. It was again their left winger causing problems but this time he turned provider, playing a low ball across for their third equaliser of the game. Things then got worse for the home side, when with 10 minutes to play, we were caught sleeping from a low, drilled corner which was finished from point blank range.</p>
<p>Naturally, members of the Roza squad began to worry that, after going up three times, we may leave with nothing.</p>
<p>Once again though, the strong mentality that has been built over the last few years playing together, came clutch. Under two minutes were remaining and we had a throw-in in our left-back position. Spyrou hauled it up the line, Smith flicked on to Reynolds, and then the latter played a ball across the pitch to Iddo Razin. Razin, who has scored multiple spectacular goals over the past few seasons, showed that this trend was not going to stop in the newest campaign. He set his sights, everyone held their breath, and when the ball dipped into the top of the goal to equalise, the Roza players and supporters erupted. It was a great moment, as Razin came to the rescue to secure us a point, with a curling effort from about 25 yards.</p>
<p>This was far from a vintage Roza performance, but it was a valuable point against a strong opponent. As much as we&rsquo;d have loved to take the three points, lots of value can be taken from the character shown, never saying die after a late goal putting us behind. We move on; and I have no doubts that our first win of the season will come soon.</p>

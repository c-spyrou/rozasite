On a hot summer’s day in 2020, five friends went for a kickabout in the local park. 
As they sat down to drink some water, one of the lads jokingly asked the rest, ‘Why don’t we create our own team?’ and from that point on, the work began from transforming this dream into reality. <br> <br>

The groundwork started from 2020, including processes to set up the club branding including naming and kits; and conversations were had daily regarding our visions for the club both in the short-term and long-term. Lots of hard work went into facilitating a sustainable football club to compete amongst the best both on and off the pitch. <br> <br>

<br>
Our first season as a club was 2022/23, and we were put in Division 6 – the eighth tier of the Barnet Sunday Football League. We celebrated a win in our first ever league match, beating Camden Town Athletic 4-3. At the end of the season, we narrowly missed out on the title, finishing in second place; but it was clear that our level on the pitch was far above a number of our league counterparts. <br> <br/>

<h4 align="left" class="tbh4" style="font-style: italic">Although we didn’t win any silverware, our first season was a curtain-raiser that everyone could be proud of.</h4> <br/>
<h5 align="justify">
As a result of our impressive campaign, we were moved up five leagues into the third tier of the Barnet Sunday Football League – Division 1. We are currently competing in this division, trying to keep the club’s positive trajectory going – and hopefully ending it with some silverware! <br> <br> </h5>

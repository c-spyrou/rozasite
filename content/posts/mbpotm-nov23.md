Following in the footsteps of our first ever Player of the Month Steph Savva, our American attacking midfielder Cal Cook took the award for November.

Cal had an excellent month in November, playing only 2 of our 3 fixtures but scoring 3 goals and assisting once in the process.
His brace against PS Birlikspor helped us to a 4-0 win, in a game where he was causing problems for the defence throughout. 

However it was his goal in the game against South Tottenham United at home which really came in clutch. At the time, we were 2-1 up
and the game was still very much in the balance. Cal took the ball on the left side of the pitch and whipped one into the top left corner to send the Roza team and fans into chaos, as this was the goal that secured us the 3 points.

<h3> Congratulations Cal... here's to more excellent performances! </h3> <br>

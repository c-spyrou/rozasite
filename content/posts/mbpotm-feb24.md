As one of the founding fathers, Michael G has always had a big part to play within the club off the pitch - but his influence on it has come leaps and bounds in recent months. He has established himself as a mainstay at the heart of the Roza engine room, and his combative nature combined with his composure has helped Roza throughout the season.

February was a great month for Georgiades. Although it was only two games, they were fixtures which he excelled in, returning one assist and helping to win the midfield battle on all occasions.

Roza came out on top in the first of the two February games, beating FC Continental 3-2 in a fixture where we really had to grind. In the second game, we were disappointingly beaten 4-3 by Barnet Borough FC, but this should not take away the plaudits that Georgiades is deservedly getting after two excellent performances.

He has now started the month of March well too - with a great performance against Fireside before another solid display, capped off with an exquisite strike, against Continental away. <a href="https://afcroza.com/conti_a_2324/"> Read more about that 1-7 drubbing at Continental here. </a>

Well done Michael - fully deserved!

On a wet and cold September morning, AFC Roza faced a confident New World side who had won both their opening fixtures of the season. Despite the challenging conditions, the pitch held up well, with the ball zipping across the surface. The atmosphere was tense as both teams aimed to assert their dominance early on.

The game began with both teams battling hard in midfield. Roza's Danny Smith stood out early on, bypassing the New World press with ease and dictating the tempo. It wasn’t long before his class paid dividends. After 20 minutes, Rees Colgan delivered one of his trademark set-piece deliveries, whipping in a deadly ball to the back post, where Danny arrived just in time to tap home. Roza were 1-0 up, and the boys celebrated what felt like a pivotal moment in the game.

New World responded with urgency, resorting to long balls in an attempt to break down the Roza defense. However, Rajan Ranu was equal to everything, sharp off his line and commanding in the air. Despite their pressure, New World couldn’t find a way through. Roza’s backline, led by Giorgio Koullas and Terry Savva, held firm, with Deano Spyrou putting in several crucial challenges to relieve pressure down the right flank. Up top, Alex Andreou, Iddo Razin, and Steph Savva pressed relentlessly, forcing New World into turnovers high up the pitch. However, it was our midfield powerhouse, Sajith Rajaratnum, who nearly capitalised on one such mistake, pressing the goalkeeper and almost setting up Iddo Razin, but a last-ditch challenge denied him.

Roza headed into halftime with a deserved 1-0 lead, knowing that New World remained dangerous. The gaffer, Mike, delivered a confident team talk, rallying the boys to stay sharp and push for more in the second half. Ollie Begueria came on for Deano Spyrou at the break, adding fresh legs to the defense.

The second half started with a bang. Just minutes in, Alex Andreou applied the manager’s message perfectly, pressing the New World full-back high up the pitch. Winning the ball, Alex drove into the box and curled a beautiful shot into the bottom corner. It was a finish reminiscent of Thierry Henry in his prime, and the Roza bench erupted in celebration. At 2-0, Roza looked in control.

But New World were not done. They upped the pressure and struck the crossbar with a long-range effort, signaling their intent. Controversy soon followed when the referee hesitated to give a clear second yellow card after a cynical foul on Steph Savva. The official also waved away strong penalty shouts after Sajith Rajaratnum appeared to be pulled down in the box during a set-piece scramble.

New World’s persistence eventually paid off. They pulled one back, scoring a well-placed shot in off the post. Roza made changes, with Adam Shaw, Michael Andreou, and Jake Koumi coming on for Steph Savva, Alex Andreou, and Iddo Razin as the team sought to shore up the defense for the final 20 minutes. Ben Reynolds, who had worked tirelessly in midfield, made way for Michael Georgiades, making his first appearance since returning from injury.

Roza were pinned back but still posed a threat on the counter. Sajith Rajaratnum and Michael Andreou combined down the left, and a dangerous cross found Adam Shaw, whose effort cannoned off the crossbar. It was a reminder that Roza were still dangerous, despite the pressure from New World.

The game took a cruel turn in the dying minutes. New World equalszed after breaking through the defense, and moments later, a controversial third goal was allowed to stand despite a clear offside. The referee, hesitant throughout the game, failed to make the decisive calls, leaving Roza feeling robbed.

The match ended 3-2, with the Roza boys understandably distraught. Despite the result, every player left everything on the pitch, and on another day, the outcome could have been very different. The squad’s fighting spirit and performance were commendable, and they will be eager to bounce back in the next game.

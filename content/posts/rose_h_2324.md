<br/>

A sunny Sunday morning in North London was the setting, with a ‘Rose Derby’ on the agenda. The game was delicately poised, with a win for either side making all the difference towards the top end of the table. Both teams came with significant support, and the game didn’t disappoint.

AFC Roza, in pink, started fast and on the front foot, and got a goal inside 10 minutes. Alex Andreou, who has been superb on his return to the side after a 3 month absence, got the ball to feet, beat his man and cut the ball back to Roza’s ever reliable number 9, Steph Savva, who finished clinically to put the home side one to the good. Roza didn’t stop there though, with Andreou and Savva constantly linking up in and around the box, whilst Iddo Razin on the right hand side continued to whip in dangerous balls for the forwards to attack. Roza hit the post twice in the next 5 minutes through both Andreou and Savva, but unfortunately couldn’t add another. Meanwhile, Michael Georgiades was crucial to everything good Roza did, battling extremely well in the middle of the park and constantly linking the backline with the Roza forwards.

AFC Rose’s game plan was clear: they continued to send the ball long for their striker to battle, and battle he did. They equalised with a goal which I think everyone on the pitch, bar the referee, knew was offside! This didn’t deter AFC Roza though, who continued to dominate. The pressure paid off soon enough, with Roza’s number 10 Danny Smith winning the ball high up the pitch, before some great interplay with Iddo Razin resulted in a dangerous strike from the latter that the keeper could only parry into Smith’s feet. 2-1 Roza. The game tightened from here on out, with neither team wanting to concede the crucial next goal before HT.

The target for AFC Roza in the second half was the same as the first, start fast and make life difficult for the opposition, and we did that. The Gaffer, Mike Anastasiou, made it clear at half time that focus was key, and we needed to continue to be aggressive from the off. “We’ve been good, but we can be better” was the rallying cry to the boys in pink, and it seemed to work.

Again, Roza took charge of the first 15 minutes of the second half. A few good chances were missed but the significant pressure on the opposition was notably having an effect. Iddo Razin, Danny Smith and Saj Rajaratnam made it impossible for the opposition to play out with the high press, allowing Roza to keep the ball in the opposition half and sustain pressure. A sub after half time due to an injury to Georgiades meant the ever-dependable Rees Colgan came into the fray, and the way he settled the ball and minds of his Roza teammates was clear to see.

The away side did not let their heads drop and continued to battle, again with the long ball their main outlet, but the Roza backline held strong, with monster performances from the centre back partnership of Chris Johnson and Giorgio Koullas, and a special mention to Eric Schmidt who also impressed on his return to the side. Not to mention Roza’s #1, Rajan Ranu, who always seems to know exactly what the game requires in each changing moment.

2 more subs were then made for AFC Roza with Andrew Michael and Nicholas Christou entering the field for the last 10 minutes – and both players executed their roles perfectly. With time running out, and tired legs starting to show for the opposition, Roza finally made the pressure pay. After a disallowed Rajaratnam goal from the previous corner, Chris Johnson was first to a loose ball in the box, scoring his second of the season, and finally putting the game to bed. AFC Roza managed the game well from there and in the end secured a victory which appeared comfortable, but credit to the team for being professional and focused throughout.  

It was a huge performance across the pitch for AFC Roza, with countless names doing themselves proud. Most notably, Chris Johnson, today’s Man of the Match, for the way he martialled the defence before securing the crucial goal to seal the game.

The Roza march on after another win in 2024, and are now looking upwards with a lot still left to play for.

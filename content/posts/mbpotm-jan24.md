Giorgio Koullas! <br> <br/> </h4>

Giorgio has been an absolute rock at the heart of the Roza defence this month, commanding the back line with strong leadership and astute defending throughout. The team's defensive cohesion has looked increasingly settled as the month has gone on, and Koullas' emerging centre-back partnership with Chris Johnson is certainly one of the main reasons for this.

January started poorly for the club with a 1-5 cup loss to Real Menza, with the opponents' finishing proving to be spot on whenever a chance presented itself.

The boys reacted excellently to this though, with Koullas proving instrumental in a monumental 2-1 win against FC Trent Park and a solid 3-1 victory against AFC Rose to end the month.

<h3> Congratulations to Giorgio who's hard work off the pitch has paid dividends on it!</h3> <br>
